        <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Medford Animal Rescueâ€™s mission is to rescue the lost, abandoned, and mistreated
            animals and provide for their relief and safety until they are reunited with a loving owner
            or placed in a new home. We are committed to the health and wellness for our animals,
            which means no pet will ever be euthanized because it has run out of time to find a
            home. We are committed to ending the overpopulation of pets that results in millions of
            companion pets being euthanized at shelters in the U.S. every year, therefore all cats,
            rabbits, and dogs adopted from us are spayed and neutered prior to adoption. We
            would appreciate your contributions and your willingness to join us in our journey!</p>
